[Culture Amp](https://www.cultureamp.com/) is a Melbourne-based people analytics platform that uses data to drive change in company cultures, helping some of the world's most innovative companies including Airbnb, Slack, Adobe, Warby Parker, Eventbrite and Etsy. Culture Amp was founded by four engineers in 2011, and was bootstrapped before it took series A funding in February 2015, growing from 15 to 50 people in that time. We have offices in Melbourne, San Francisco and New York. We're also a culture-first company, which means we try and "sample our own home brew" using our own platform to put culture and people at the heart of all our decisions.
